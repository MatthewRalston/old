### Blogging

When I began blogging, I was looking for a way to supplement my portfolio with details of the qualitative kind: passion projects, social causes, current events, social interactions, conversational style, and interpersonal perspectives. It was also an opportunity to describe perspectives, demonstrate critical thinking and attention to details, and practice my rhetorical abilities to those who could advocate my positions or at the least, consider them.

### What to add, and what not to.

The last element I wanted to emphasize in my digital footprint was what was left unstated by the combination of my open source portfolio, my website and blog, and my CV/resume. Employers looking for certain skills may view a lack of SQL code in the codebase as evidence of little practical experience, unless you emphasize it heavily in your CV. If you're not that interested or educated in what database managers daily routines look like, then perhaps that's a good reason to leave it out of your portfolio in a conceivable way.
