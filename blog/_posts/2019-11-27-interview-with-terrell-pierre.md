## Personal introduction

My name is Matt, and I'm a former biologist. I do open-source work on microbial genomics, which is the study of how bacteria can produce things like human insulin, proteins, and small molecules for human therapy. 

I have a small blog with less than 50 views per week called Not Very Humerus. It's geared towards bioinformatics students struggling with anxieties of college, grad-school, post-doc, and industry transitions. I try to embed memes in my posts to give some comedic flavor, and I mostly focus on computer technologies relating to biology research.

I was recently dismissed from my job as a scientist and I work as a cashier at Wawa. When I'm not behind the counter handing out cigarettes to people, I like to play DotA2, talk to friends on the phone, and watch youtube. I lift at home sometimes and go to concerts. My favorite artist is a 2000's alt-rock band called Chevelle, but I like listening to EDM, hip-hop, 90's rap, and instrumental guitar music. My family is important to me, but my mom is a little too controlling.

Career and social anxiety is a big topic on reddit channels, and some of my blog's content and attempts at comedy revolve around that area. I get nervous talking to others about my addiction to cigarettes, race issues, and career change. 

I want to say that talking with you is a privelege, and I'm very nervous. If you want to poke fun at my appearance or ask some questions about me, I'd be happy. 

I take myself too seriously, and I think you'll find some of the questions I have... deep or topical, and there isn't any rush on my end. If you'd like to do the interview in segments, I'd be happy to oblige.

## Disclaimer

I want you to know that I have no current affiliations with CP or other disability research, that I used to work for the pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb, and that this interview took place after my dismissal from the firm for behavioral issues. I want you to state that the interview was purely driven by my love for FilthyFrankTV and friends who work in fields relating to ableism.

My intention is to write a brief blog post about relationships, music, media, comedy, your youtube channel Terrell, and your collaboration with FilthyFrankTV?

When it comes time for me to write a draft, would you consent to reviewing my draft and approving the content before it's posted?

Do you consent to my recording the audio of our interview that will not be released, and a copy will be e-mailed to you? 

If any question is too specific or you'd like to skip it, would you tell me you'd like to talk about something else? Maybe half of the questions I have are about Terrell Pierre TV and its influences, and half is about technology and relationships.

Would you review a draft of the sections I'd like to put in a post on my blog Not Very Humerus before it gets posted? Would you mind if I asked your consent again before I post any content to Not Very Humerus?

## Relationships


Does family anxiety get in the way of some of your extroversion?

*strike* Does ableism get in the way of you forming friendships with some cats that would otherwise really like someone so humorous? 

Can you describe your relationship with Frank? Does the non-PC nature of his comedy mesh or clash with your style? 

Frank has one of the most outspoken and offensive channels on youtube. He has a wild sense of humor, but a tremendous creativity. What do you think of his channel? Do you mind if I ask about his episode 'Pimp My Wheelchair'?

*strike*Or is his non-PC nature kind of an example for the thick skin you need to wade through the comments sections and fanmail, to keep your heart where it needs to be?

What is your relationship like with your fans?

*strike*How do you primarily keep in contact with your fans, Patreon, Youtube comments? 

*strike*Is there anything you want to say about your friends and moments you feel at peace?

*strike*At what age was your first date and what was it like? Where did you go? Group date or solo? When you got home, did it feel like you had made a step, or did it shake yourself into the vibrant personality you have today, where you use humor to hold people at a distance?

## Media

Favorite comedy movies/shows?

Favorite movie/show about ableism?

Who is your top comedian?

Are there any comedians that deal directly with ableism and what works have influenced your own channel's style?

Favorite music genres?

## Hip-hop Music and Machismo

How has the pervasive 'beef' culture in rap/hip-hop affected your comedic style? 

In the 'Pimp My Wheelchair' episode, you're busting his balls a lot and dissing. Is that typical of your relationship with him, or was that mostly to help him stay in character throughout the episode?

For many young boys and men, lyrics about stealing women from others speaks loads about both dating, marriage, and perception of masculinity. Do you think that the sexualization of rap culture is helping that message? How about sexual hip-hop?

Was that confidence something you and Frank were trying to communicate in the episode?

## The Rough Ride

Can you talk a little bit about the famous 'Pimp My Wheelchair' episode on Frank's channel? 

When was it filmed?

How did the idea start?

I was just... amazed at the episode. It was one of the most down-to-earth and yet extremely offensive youtube videos I have ever seen.

I was offended by the racial components and confused by your attitude's throughout, especially the alcohol and cigar references, and the whole episode looks like he's using you to boost his channel. It made me feel uncomfortable laughing at how serious your dating game is, let alone how personal style affects friendships, especially those who you're close with like Frank. I'm really confused by the episode and what it says about Frank's comedy and how different it is from his normally absurd style. His channel is so much more real and surrealistic than almost any other comedy, even absurd comedy like "This is not happening".

What was the core message? In your own words, can you explain what you and Frank were trying to say about the intersection of ableism, personal style, and your own game and friendships?

## Technology and Culture

What did you study in college?

*strike*What is your perspective on sequencing technology and CP biomedical research?
*strike*What do feel about pharmaceutical prioritization of CP therapies?
*strike*My blog is mostly tutorials for bioinformaticians.

What technological or social-networking issues are faced by those in the CP community, not pertaining to entertainment or career, but just about daily life? 

How about CP entertainers and the entertainment industry?

What would you need to upgrade your own channel as far as AV needs and web technologies are concerned?

Are there any other channels that inspire your own work or the messages you'd like to send about life, relationships, and career?

Do you feel like the internet helps you have a more vibrant social life, or is more damaging to the social lives of those with differences/disabilities?

What is the best youtube comment you've received?

## Support Network

Without getting into any specifics, what therapies old or new that have helped you the most? Did you discover them through your journey or were they word of mouth mostly?

Does white-coat syndrome affect you?

It's clear in that video that you have an amazing social group. And I feel very anxious because it's obviously much larger and more important than my own social groups. Like... you've got game.

I've felt confused by my own ableism and how it affects my social style. One of the best professors I've ever had was a bench and theoretical chemist who was handicappable, and he was also the funniest. What do you to help friends and attendees, to help them relax and ease their social anxieties about your condition?
