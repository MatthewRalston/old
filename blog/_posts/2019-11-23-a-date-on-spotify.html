<p><em>Imagine some dude talking to younger girls about a spotify playlist playing at a party. The girls are a little bit tipsy, and he's talking to them about his chromatic perceptions of the music. Spotify playlists are to soundcloud the same way mixtapes were to mid-level rappers talking about musical ideas. But it takes a consistent and deeper conversation to really say anything, and no-one wants to listen. So imagine a guy who is able to talk about music people at the party are really vibing with, and how it relates to the artists musical abilities, statements, and music history. It's a fever dream.</em></p>

<p>I've got a few playlists on spotify, but they haven't amounted to much yet.</p>

<p>I create them sporatically, and they always revolve around themes but never any particular event or date. And I've always really wanted to pick the right date to change up my spotify themeing. And we don't have a lot of good songs that are original that stick the current themes of my musical explorations, nor any consequential themes or patterns during playlist generation. Do we need a feeling first, or does the energy itself manifest into a playlist.</p>

<p>I mean, you could think of what it would take to get to a good nightclub themetrack but it doesn't take much time or effort to show many signs or figurative language in a <a class="hidden" href="#" data-toggle="popover" title="" data-placement="auto" data-trigger="hover" data-html=true data-content='<audio autoplay controls><source src="{{ base }}/assets/img/DROELOE_facing_the_sea.mp3", type="audio/mpeg"></audio>'>single song</a>, but when you spread the language over many different types of moden electronic dance media, the form of a single song takes much much longer to reconstruct.</p>

<p>Do you see what I'm saying? It's like if you could combine a playlist down to a single song, how would that work? How do you pick which tracks go where in a playlist, and how you want the mood to change or revolve around certain themes? What if the whole process was done in reverse? Decompressing a single song's moods into a whole playlist? Cause that's essentially what you're trying to do when you're building a playlist from a single song whose vibes or energy you're trying to emulate.</p>

<p>So anyway I was trying to come up with some themes in modern EDM sounds and describe where the appropriative sounds can reflect other eras in American musical appreciation, post jazz, brass fascination left in the wake of modern synth tech, and its mainstay in R&B has led to certain... fascination with borrowing non-synth sampling for totally musically subversive hypnosis in the uh... in the brainspace or whatever. Like contexts that frame these moments in music history. Sure there's music appropriation and race issues and stuff like that, but it's also a conversation about influences, references, inspiration.</p>

<p>The conversation about appropriation between songs, artists, genres, countries is ultimately also one about attribution.</p>


<p>These are things that can't be recovered or rediscovered except by our own perspectives in music taste through the earwaves or whatever. It's personal. The ear was a more sensitive sensory organ that I anticipated, and I needed to dumb the noise down a little since it was a positive influence in my tastes, and I don't equilibrate it often. Sometimes I'm too up and the music is too up, sometimes it's too downtempo and I lose track of conversations cause I feel like going to sleep. Anyway appropriation/attribution and how your musical taste forms is definitely racial or whatever.</p>

<p>All of our music is just regurgitation of the same emotions but they get absorbed in different ways or whatever but it's like... a sound from within as much as it's a sound from the sides of music you wanna strike your own little conversations with. I kept my base flavor kind of grungy so I could remember the difference between the precision of EDM synth tones, how fast they hit because talent is driven by pacing of melody as much as its driven by pace of tempo stability, and it needs to be contrasted with the musical realities musicians face making new samples or even new conclusions about their own musical tastes. And so the themes inside a single song or playlist is a conversation about race, taste, and identity.</p>

<p>So yeah the flavor of industrial and grunge kind of resonated with my economic fears of the time, and it just seemed like something was missing the first time I listened to the hits from those genres so I internalized the preference and it came out transmuted in some songs I find particularly violent, offensive, childish, or even explicit in the deliver of their message. Of course music relates to conversation, friendship, and even sexuality to an extent, but it's also about asexuality in the way your tastes change or don't change over time, the type of music you find mature or immature, the memes in your own brain about the music you're listening to, and what you think it says about your taste or your style. Anyway this first one is a particularly disgusting track.</p>

<p>It's got like a very offensive and almost churlish jabs at chinese folk rhythms. But the brass emphasizes the conflict and cultural memes the authors are wrestling with and why they need to understand it through a rhythmic context. The EDM harmonic railings sound like speed boosting and lane switching, evoking the feeling of traffic and the anxiety of direction taking, almost like bumpers on a damn civic. Sounds dumb and childish right? Especially because the main melody and bouncing tempo is serious and severe, harsh... having the tonal space to make that harmonic undertone was a cool choice the musicians made to frame the seriousness of the main theme in a more childish racing game context most men idolize about the urbanization and technologies they were told to sexualize... in this modern context.</p>

<p>It's even, a bit friendly towards the ongoing conversation specifically because of the rhythmic paces they take in the space between the main dissonances that drift in and out of the main melody. Do you see that those 'bumpers' aren't even consistent in the place of the rhythm section. There's this constant 'tip toe' melodic meme that makes the main theme more violent, the rhythm is regurgitated in other tonal wavelengths that sometimes feel asynchronous with the melody. The 'boosting' feeling driving the melody through its ignorant contexts provides a sense of relatable feeling to the way boys find conversation, education, self-exploration, even taste to be a draining and idiotic process that never leads anywhere predictable or understandable... then that part of the melody resolves into the space between the choruses and the verse, where there's melodic and rhythmic release, slow down and slight distraction from how offensive the main melody really is. The question is, why are the artists tip-toeing with their pizzicato notes and yet integrating that theme into the main melody. Why aren't the two disparate? They use that theme to build in one case towards the main beat drops, and that's why the main theme isn't... linear or planar, it's a beam. It's got circular shape: repetition. It's *not* the melody. The melody is actually the bumpers and rhythm section, you're not supposed to focus on the beam, but it's entrancing because of how offensive it is. It's a distraction for the discussion about traffic, turns, and cut-outs it needs to even frame the melody in something remotely musically relieving... the other theme with the brighter sounding tones sounds tired and dejected, an intermission that you need to get past to get to the beef.</p>

<p>Anyway this other track in the list is more of a pure EDM sound exploration, than a beef track. It's bright and brilliant in sound, but the coolest part of the intro is the pathways of light that Madeon uses to find a sound from under, from hidden. Each note has a longevity, but the arpegiation gives feelings of multiplicity. You can't always see the direction, they're distractions, but the intro sounds underwater. The rhythmic piano has a sound that's very different from the shimmering. It's a train, it's a pace, it has the sound of drinking. Sip gulp, sip gulp. But it's faster than biological pace, so you have to hear it while you're reclining during the light show. It comes from peripheral vision of the shimmering, but it's clearly liquid. Single notes, bright colors, major theme, soft volume. It's clearly not the focus of the intro.</p>

<p>Alright, imagine for a second, asshole, that pitch is the same thing as height. You can hear these low bubbling sounds in the intro, and these shimmering high-hotes that are coming down.</p>

<p><em>He's talking about the Disney meets Japanese animation themes emerging from water or some shit...</em></p>

<p>The synth strobes in the middle, just above in tone and outwards in timbre from the uh... main melodic question, is a strobing that's tonic, it's a pace, and it's cyclical, even though there's notes and flickering. Kind of like wings. The main theme at this point, however, is a vector, a choice. It's alternating, but there's no complexity to it. It *lacks* in musical form, because it's such a simple melody with little harmonic space to it. It's also different in volume from the shimmer, a distraction that was supposed to be so embedded and secret from the suggestions made by the stupid intro. Water, cleanliness, emergence. Very Kingdom Hearts meets Super Smash Bros I guess. Especially because the shimmering is coming back into the song at a fuller velocity than the more pointless melodic theme that is emerging into the song by virtue of the drop and the the full rhythm section that is subtle and patient at the beginning.</p>

<p><em>But then he sees this vehicular theme or something that's kind of cool if you can hear it.</em></p>

<p>Again, the theme is clearly vehicular, but you can't tell where you are in time or any spatial things in the song. It's the sound of emergence into the vehicular context. And interestingly, immature video game themes are peripheral to the main rhythms and pace. There's colors and shimmering, but it's periodic, the main role is supposed to be low, darker, and more monotonic. That's why they only come in to the first iteration. The frequency of the shimmering is much lower in the second verse. Only at the end of the song does the wing theme reappear, but that's why Icarus is such a cool song about cars and why they're important to how men approach musical thought.</p>

<p>Uh the new first track... lol. Just keeping on top. Whatever. Uh, so the new first song is spectrally impenetrable. Crazy. The tempo is too fast for you to decipher, it feels more like... uh...a.... uh...color wheel or some shit. Like a lolipop. You're supposed to relisten to it several times anyway. So the cooler part is the klaxons, sounds like laser guns. You can even hear the recoil in the space of the flash, which is really fucking dope. More of a blop, or bock, then a thwap. Which makes it sound more... idk male or whatever.</p>

<p>"BOCKBOCKBOCKBOCK BOCKBOCK BOOOOCCCKK" But you hear the blips right? That's the spectrum. It adds a component to the descent in color of the phasers. But rhythmically it's a chicken noise. And a really powerful one, because of the other melodic themes that are framing everything. This one's gonna take a second to kick in, hold in. On. or whaever.</p>

<p>Whatever dickwad, comeback when you finally hear the trampoline at the beginning of the main riff. Like straight up Wreck-It Ralph.</p>

<p>The first sound of the entire song is a little trampoline. Cause that's how riffs start or whatever. It's like... sometimes when you're playing guitar, you switch out of rhythm and into a riff, and the riffs are faster, catchier, and everyone likes them, but they're expensive. But for this group, they're really cheap. So he doesn't dress up the transition from rhythm to riff, instead it's more like a pickup note. It reminds me of Wreck-It Ralph or something. Or whatever. Anyways, it's kind of interesting that this band prefers glissando, bending to straight arpegiation inside of their painting in the single dimension. That's a good mark, it's like a talent thing or whatever. The song is taunting actually. Cluck cluck. Up here, away from the clucking. The clucking is more like... a ... cascading or whatever. Color to the koolaid that draws most people right into the melody and clock they're trying to set up for the verse to have credibility. Because the verse in this case *is* purely chromatic and not verbal. That's why the chorus has to be so offensive. He says sit down once. That was funny.</p>

<p>Here, if you can say if you see here the diminished cluster is an 'okay'. But which cluster? The password is February 4th, 2010 to January 2nd, 2016. Disappointing. Their chromeo is stronger than your chromeo.</p>

<p>Anyway, I gotta go to sleep on this one. Too good to stay awake for, idrgaf.</p>

<p>So Tokyo Machine was listed with MonsterCat, and I found the song somewhere during my DotA2 phase. It's kind of a plain dub, with 16bit references, the bassline is an even 'square', too. Kinda cool, right? It's not a dance track at all... for women. I don't really have to say much about this song.</p>

<p>Anonymous is obviously a love song, but it's more of a waltz or a ballroom dance than a 'vibing' song or dance song. I hear contemporary ballet in it, but it's kind of hard to see. There's so many tonal centers thrown in.</p>


<p><em>The party continues, the haters are gone, and it's just the melodrama of the group, their animosity to him, and his fascination with the girls who are smart/dumb enough to listen to his rant. Like all men are.</em></p>
