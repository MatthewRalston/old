Not Very Humerus is a non-Loblaw blog about science, technology, school, and industry life as a millenial. It does not cover my personal life or reflect perspectives of acquaintances or organizations I have formal and informal associations with (see the <a href="about#Disclaimer">Disclaimer</a>). It is intended to be a fun (YMMV) discussion of science, technology, and millenial life.
