  ## What is a digital portfolio?

  It isn't simply a statement towards employers. A good digital portfolio illustrates diverse skills and complex systems in a clean, plain view for teammates to quickly understand experiences, tools, and interests.

  A current interest is having one or more successful open source projects under my belt, to have experience in collaborative coding. Secondly, I enjoy theoretical and performance assessments of my calculators in Rmd, to become a better analyst. Also, I have interests in citizen-science or science education projects including the PublicLab spectrophotometer and simple spectroscopy projects.

    subtitle: A clean and simple K-mer library for Python
    description: |-
      KDB is a Python library designed for bioinformatics applications. It addresses the ['k-mer' problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer) (substrings of length k) in a simple and performant manner. It generates a k-mer spectrum/profile and stores the profile to the `.kdb` format spec, a bgzf file similar to BAM. 

    features:
      - bgzf file + index
      - K-mer count histogram (4^k)
      - Multiplexed inputs
      - bgzf header block
      - CLI and Python module
